Here's a simplified summary of the text in under 100 words: Enzymes can be highly optimized and efficient, but their persistence without clear evolutionary pressure is puzzling. By studying the history of bi-functional enzyme HisA over two billion years, we found that ancient versions catalyzed mult...

Model Output:
Here's a simplified summary of the study for a general audience: Researchers have long studied how the sequence of a protein determines its structure. This relationship, known as the "sequence-structure map," is important for understanding how proteins function and evolve. In this study, the researc...

Microtubules are nano-machines that grow and shrink stochastically , making use of the coupling between chemical kinetics and mechanics of its constituent protofilaments ( PFs ) . We investigate the stability and shrinkage of microtubules taking into account inter-protofilament interactions and bend

Model Output:
Here's a simplified summary of the excerpt for a general audience: Microtubules, found in cells, are like nano-machines that grow and shrink randomly due to chemical kinetics and mechanical forces. We studied how these microtubules behave and why they shrink. We showed that the competition between e...
