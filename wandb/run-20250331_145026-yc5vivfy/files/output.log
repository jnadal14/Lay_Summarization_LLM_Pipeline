Input (first 3 lines):
In systems and computational biology , much effort is devoted to functional identification of systems and networks at the molecular-or cellular scale . However , similarly important networks exist at anatomical scales such as the tendon network of human fingers: the complex array of collagen fibers

Model Output:
Here is a summary of the text in under 100 words: Researchers have developed a new approach to inferring the functional structure of complex biological networks, using experimental interrogation with force inputs. They applied this approach to a tendon network in the human hand and found that functi...

Input (first 3 lines):
Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) is the major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer . Our laboratory has reported that the Sonic Hedgehog ( Shh ) signaling pathway is an early response to infection that is fundamental to the initiation of H . pylori-induced gastritis . H . pylori also

Model Output:
Here is a summary of the text in under 100 words: H. pylori infection leads to increased PD-L1 expression in the gastric epithelium, which may protect premalignant lesions from the immune response and progress to gastric cancer. H. pylori induces Shh signaling within the gastric epithelium, leading ...

Input (first 3 lines):
Small RNAs are functional molecules that modulate mRNA transcripts and have been implicated in the aetiology of several common diseases . However , little is known about the extent of their variability within the human population . Here , we characterise the extent , causes , and effects of naturall

Model Output:
Here is the summary in under 100 words: This study investigated naturally occurring variation in small RNA expression and sequence in the human population. The research found that highly expressed small RNAs are more conserved across mammals, while those with variable expression are associated with ...

Input (first 3 lines):
Modern enzymes are highly optimized biocatalysts that process their substrates with extreme efficiency . Many enzymes catalyze more than one reaction; however , the persistence of such ambiguities , their consequences and evolutionary causes are largely unknown . As a paradigmatic case , we study th

Model Output:
Here is the summary in under 100 words: ["Your simplified summary here"] The text discusses the concept of bi-functionality in enzymes, where an enzyme can catalyze multiple reactions without any evolutionary pressure. Using a case study on the sugar isomerase HisA from histidine biosynthesis, the a...

Input (first 3 lines):
The correspondence between protein sequences and structures , or sequence-structure map , relates to fundamental aspects of structural , evolutionary and synthetic biology . The specifics of the mapping , such as the fraction of accessible sequences and structures , or the sequences' ability to fold
