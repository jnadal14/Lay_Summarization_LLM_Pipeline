    "In systems and computational biology , much effort is devoted to functional identification of systems and networks at the molecular-or cellular scale . However , similarly important networks exist at anatomical scales such as the tendon network of human fingers: the complex array of collagen fibers that transmits and distributes muscle forces to finger joints . This network is critical to the versatility of the human hand , and its function has been debated since at least the 16th century . Here , we experimentally infer the structure ( both topology and parameter values ) of this network through sparse interrogation with force inputs . A population of models representing this structure co-evolves in simulation with a population of informative future force inputs via the predator-prey estimation-exploration algorithm . Model fitness depends on their ability to explain experimental data , while the fitness of future force inputs depends on causing maximal functional discrepancy among current models . We validate our approach by inferring two known synthetic Latex networks , and one anatomical tendon network harvested from a cadaver's middle finger . We find that functionally similar but structurally diverse models can exist within a narrow range of the training set and cross-validation errors . For the Latex networks , models with low training set error [<4%] and resembling the known network have the smallest cross-validation errors [\u223c5%] . The low training set [<4%] and cross validation [<7 . 2%] errors for models for the cadaveric specimen demonstrate what , to our knowledge , is the first experimental inference of the functional structure of complex anatomical networks . This work expands current bioinformatics inference approaches by demonstrating that sparse , yet informative interrogation of biological specimens holds significant computational advantages in accurate and efficient inference over random testing , or assuming model topology and only inferring parameters values . These findings also hold clues to both our evolutionary history and the development of versatile machines . Much attention is given to functional networks ( e . g . , scale-free , small world and others ) resulting from the complex interactions between their constituents [e . g . , 1\u20135] . For example , the mechanisms of module assembly in biological molecular networks [6]\u2013[8] ( with underlying motifs [9] ) exhibit coordinated , complex functionalities; interconnectivity among unreliable elements yields reliable dynamic performance [10]\u2013[12] . Similarly , the study of a complex biological system as a whole can be emphasized to understand how system properties emerge from the interaction of multiple components [13]\u2013[15] . Tendon networks at anatomical scales are intricate and poorly understood componentsof the neuromuscular control of the hand . Understanding their functional characteristics is critical to gaining insight into the brain-body co-evolution that has facilitated dexterous manipulation in modern humans , as well as improving clinical rehabilitation strategies in orthopedic and neurological conditions . The complexity of tendon networks of the fingers is legendary , and thus the so-called Winslow's rhombus is a generic topological approximation that has",
    "Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) is the major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer . Our laboratory has reported that the Sonic Hedgehog ( Shh ) signaling pathway is an early response to infection that is fundamental to the initiation of H . pylori-induced gastritis . H . pylori also induces programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression on gastric epithelial cells , yet the mechanism is unknown . We hypothesize that H . pylori-induced PD-L1 expression within the gastric epithelium is mediated by the Shh signaling pathway during infection . To identify the role of Shh signaling as a mediator of H . pylori-induced PD-L1 expression , human gastric organoids generated from either induced pluripotent stem cells ( HGOs ) or tissue ( huFGOs ) were microinjected with bacteria and treated with Hedgehog/Gli inhibitor GANT61 . Gastric epithelial monolayers generated from the huFGOs were also infected with H . pylori and treated with GANT61 to study the role of Hedgehog signaling as a mediator of induced PD-1 expression . A patient-derived organoid/autologous immune cell co-culture system infected with H . pylori and treated with PD-1 inhibitor ( PD-1Inh ) was developed to study the protective mechanism of PD-L1 in response to bacterial infection . H . pylori significantly increased PD-L1 expression in organoid cultures 48 hours post-infection when compared to uninfected controls . The mechanism was cytotoxic associated gene A ( CagA ) dependent . This response was blocked by pretreatment with GANT61 . Anti-PD-L1 treatment of H . pylori infected huFGOs , co-cultured with autologous patient cytotoxic T lymphocytes and dendritic cells , induced organoid death . H . pylori-induced PD-L1 expression is mediated by the Shh signaling pathway within the gastric epithelium . Cells infected with H . pylori that express PD-L1 may be protected from the immune response , creating premalignant lesions progressing to gastric cancer . Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) infects nearly 50% of the world's population and is the number one risk factor for gastric cancer [1] . Albeit a controversial issue , it may be that although H . pylori infection treated with antibiotics is cleared , once a patient has progressed to a metaplastic phenotype , elimination of the bacteria does not reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer [2] . H . pylori induces pathogenesis by injecting one key virulence factor cytotoxic associated gene A ( CagA ) into the gastric epithelial cells [3] . Importantly , CagA stimulates a drastic increase in Sonic Hedgehog ( Shh ) signaling from parietal cells , a response that is mediated by NF\u03baB signaling [4 , 5] . Shh is a gastric morphogen known to initiate gastritis in response to H . pylori infection [4] . Upon infection H . pylori induces the secretion of Shh from the acid-secreting parietal cells [4] . Following a sustained increase in Shh secretion and signaling , macrophages are recruited to the infection site [4] . These macrophages secrete IL-1\u03b2",
    "Small RNAs are functional molecules that modulate mRNA transcripts and have been implicated in the aetiology of several common diseases . However , little is known about the extent of their variability within the human population . Here , we characterise the extent , causes , and effects of naturally occurring variation in expression and sequence of small RNAs from adipose tissue in relation to genotype , gene expression , and metabolic traits in the MuTHER reference cohort . We profiled the expression of 15 to 30 base pair RNA molecules in subcutaneous adipose tissue from 131 individuals using high-throughput sequencing , and quantified levels of 591 microRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs . We identified three genetic variants and three RNA editing events . Highly expressed small RNAs are more conserved within mammals than average , as are those with highly variable expression . We identified 14 genetic loci significantly associated with nearby small RNA expression levels , seven of which also regulate an mRNA transcript level in the same region . In addition , these loci are enriched for variants significant in genome-wide association studies for body mass index . Contrary to expectation , we found no evidence for negative correlation between expression level of a microRNA and its target mRNAs . Trunk fat mass , body mass index , and fasting insulin were associated with more than twenty small RNA expression levels each , while fasting glucose had no significant associations . This study highlights the similar genetic complexity and shared genetic control of small RNA and mRNA transcripts , and gives a quantitative picture of small RNA expression variation in the human population . A world of noncoding RNA molecules has been uncovered in the last decades , expanding our understanding of functional elements in the genome [1] . After it was found that the small ( \u223c15\u201330 nt ) noncoding RNAs can directly modulate protein levels [2] , [3] , and via that , almost any cellular process [4] , they have been subject to vigorous study , leading to the recognition that several different types of small RNAs can act as posttranscriptional regulators [5] . MicroRNA genes ( miRNAs ) were the first animal small RNA genes to be discovered [6] , and over 1 , 500 examples have been found in humans to date [7] . The primary miRNA transcript has a stem loop structure that is recognised and cleaved via RNA processing enzymes to produce a double stranded duplex [8] . The mature miRNA strand is loaded into a complex containing Argonaute family proteins and guided to targeting , while the other strand is assumed to be degraded . miRNAs target mRNA transcripts via base pair complementarity , typically in the 3\u2032 untranslated region [8] , [9] , but also coding sequence [10] . This targeting can induce transcript cleavage , degradation , destabilisation , or repression of translation , thus modulating protein levels . Small nucleolar RNAs ( snoRNAs ) are typically",
    "Modern enzymes are highly optimized biocatalysts that process their substrates with extreme efficiency . Many enzymes catalyze more than one reaction; however , the persistence of such ambiguities , their consequences and evolutionary causes are largely unknown . As a paradigmatic case , we study the history of bi-functionality for a time span of approximately two billion years for the sugar isomerase HisA from histidine biosynthesis . To look back in time , we computationally reconstructed and experimentally characterized three HisA predecessors . We show that these ancient enzymes catalyze not only the HisA reaction but also the isomerization of a similar substrate , which is commonly processed by the isomerase TrpF in tryptophan biosynthesis . Moreover , we found that three modern-day HisA enzymes from Proteobacteria and Thermotogae also possess low TrpF activity . We conclude that this bi-functionality was conserved for at least two billion years , most likely without any evolutionary pressure . Although not actively selected for , this trait can become advantageous in the case of a gene loss . Such exaptation is exemplified by the Actinobacteria that have lost the trpF gene but possess the bi-functional HisA homolog PriA , which adopts the roles of both HisA and TrpF . Our findings demonstrate that bi-functionality can perpetuate in the absence of selection for very long time-spans . Enzymes are remarkably specific catalysts and this characteristic led to the traditional view of \u201cone enzyme , one substrate , one reaction\u201d , which assumes an evolutionary preference for mono-functionality . However , it is clear now that enzymes can catalyze reactions other than those for which they evolved; see [1] and references therein . Prominent examples of multi-functional enzymes are glutathione S-transferases and cytochrome P450s , which can process several different substrates [1] . However , multi-functional enzymes may cause metabolic conflicts if they are involved in different , possibly independent , metabolic pathways [2] . Along these lines , multi-functionality seems to be of no immediate advantage for an organism , which argues against a positive selection of this trait . Presumably , neutral drift causes the broadening or narrowing of reaction specificity , see [1] and references therein; however it is unclear , whether multi-functionality is a short-term or a long-term trait . Some evolutionary innovations originate non-adaptively as exaptations [3] , i . e . as by-products of other , positively selected traits . These features were not built by natural selection for their current role . For example , feathers evolved for temperature regulation prior to their function in flight [3] and the light-refracting lens crystallins stem from enzymes [4] . In silico analyses suggest that exaptation is an important means of evolutionary innovation for metabolic systems [5] . The contribution of exaptation to evolutionary processes would be of even greater importance , if such traits existed over a long evolutionary time-span . In order to address this issue , we traced bi-functionality of a key metabolic enzyme over two billion years",
    "The correspondence between protein sequences and structures , or sequence-structure map , relates to fundamental aspects of structural , evolutionary and synthetic biology . The specifics of the mapping , such as the fraction of accessible sequences and structures , or the sequences' ability to fold fast , are dictated by the type of interactions between the monomers that compose the sequences . The set of possible interactions between monomers is encapsulated by the potential energy function . In this study , I explore the impact of the relative forces of the potential on the architecture of the sequence-structure map . My observations rely on simple exact models of proteins and random samples of the space of potential energy functions of binary alphabets . I adopt a graph perspective and study the distribution of viable sequences and the structures they produce , as networks of sequences connected by point mutations . I observe that the relative proportion of attractive , neutral and repulsive forces defines types of potentials , that induce sequence-structure maps of vastly different architectures . I characterize the properties underlying these differences and relate them to the structure of the potential . Among these properties are the expected number and relative distribution of sequences associated to specific structures and the diversity of structures as a function of sequence divergence . I study the types of binary potentials observed in natural amino acids and show that there is a strong bias towards only some types of potentials , a bias that seems to characterize the folding code of natural proteins . I discuss implications of these observations for the architecture of the sequence-structure map of natural proteins , the construction of random libraries of peptides , and the early evolution of the natural amino acid alphabet . The implications of understanding the properties and organization of the sequence-structure map of proteins are broad , they range from explaining the diversity of known protein folds in the context of cellular physiology and their evolution [1] , synthesize molecules of biomedical or industrial interest [2] , to engineer polymers [3] and proteomes de novo . From an evolutionary standpoint the relation between sequence and structure is a particular case of a more general problem known as the genotype-phenotype map ( GP map ) [4] . According to the GP map framework , protein sequences correspond to genotypes and structures to phenotypes [5] . By using a measure of distance ( e . g . the number of point mutations necessary to transform one genotype into another ) , sequences can be thought as part of a space of genotypes [6] . A graph theoretic representation of genotype space provides a quantitative , unifying framework to explore different properties of the sequence-structure relation , while considering these properties on a broader evolutionary perspective . In the following , I refer to this detailed characterization of the sequence-structure map , as its architecture . The study of the sequence-structure map of proteins",
    "Electrophysiological studies of the human heart face the fundamental challenge that experimental data can be acquired only from patients with underlying heart disease . Regarding human atria , there exist sizable gaps in the understanding of the functional role of cellular Ca2+ dynamics , which differ crucially from that of ventricular cells , in the modulation of excitation-contraction coupling . Accordingly , the objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model of the human atrial myocyte that , in addition to the sarcolemmal ( SL ) ion currents , accounts for the heterogeneity of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics emerging from a structurally detailed sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) . Based on the simulation results , our model convincingly reproduces the principal characteristics of Ca2+ dynamics: 1 ) the biphasic increment during the upstroke of the Ca2+ transient resulting from the delay between the peripheral and central SR Ca2+ release , and 2 ) the relative contribution of SL Ca2+ current and SR Ca2+ release to the Ca2+ transient . In line with experimental findings , the model also replicates the strong impact of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics on the shape of the action potential . The simulation results suggest that the peripheral SR Ca2+ release sites define the interface between Ca2+ and AP , whereas the central release sites are important for the fire-diffuse-fire propagation of Ca2+ diffusion . Furthermore , our analysis predicts that the modulation of the action potential duration due to increasing heart rate is largely mediated by changes in the intracellular Na+ concentration . Finally , the results indicate that the SR Ca2+ release is a strong modulator of AP duration and , consequently , myocyte refractoriness/excitability . We conclude that the developed model is robust and reproduces many fundamental aspects of the tight coupling between SL ion currents and intracellular Ca2+ signaling . Thus , the model provides a useful framework for future studies of excitation-contraction coupling in human atrial myocytes . In cardiac myocytes , the process triggered by the action potential ( AP ) and resulting in the contraction of the myocyte is commonly referred to as excitation-contraction coupling ( ECC ) [1] . The transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ( [Ca2+]i ) that underlies the contraction is initiated by the Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space through the L-type calcium channels ( LTCCs ) , which causes the release of more Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) via the SR calcium release channels ( ryanodine receptors; RyRs ) , This mechanism is known as Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release ( CICR ) [2] . During one contraction cycle , the Ca2+ influx has to be balanced with an efflux to the same compartments , in order that Ca2+does not start to accumulate and impede contraction . The majority of Ca2+ is re-circulated back to the SR by the SR Ca2+-ATPase ( SERCA ) , leaving a smaller fraction of Ca2+ to be extruded from the cell by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger",
    "Microtubules are nano-machines that grow and shrink stochastically , making use of the coupling between chemical kinetics and mechanics of its constituent protofilaments ( PFs ) . We investigate the stability and shrinkage of microtubules taking into account inter-protofilament interactions and bending interactions of intrinsically curved PFs . Computing the free energy as a function of PF tip position , we show that the competition between curvature energy , inter-PF interaction energy and entropy leads to a rich landscape with a series of minima that repeat over a length-scale determined by the intrinsic curvature . Computing Langevin dynamics of the tip through the landscape and accounting for depolymerization , we calculate the average unzippering and shrinkage velocities of GDP protofilaments and compare them with the experimentally known results . Our analysis predicts that the strength of the inter-PF interaction ( E m s ) has to be comparable to the strength of the curvature energy ( E m b ) such that E m s \u2212 E m b \u2248 1 k B T , and questions the prevalent notion that unzippering results from the domination of bending energy of curved GDP PFs . Our work demonstrates how the shape of the free energy landscape is crucial in explaining the mechanism of MT shrinkage where the unzippered PFs will fluctuate in a set of partially peeled off states and subunit dissociation will reduce the length . Microtubules ( MT ) are a unique kind of supramolecular structures that are integral to a number of cellular processes , such as chromosome segregation , cell motility , intracellular transport and organization [1\u20134] . They are always in a dynamic state , displaying a phenomenon known as dynamic instability , characterized by cycles of sustained growth and rapid shrinkage [5 , 6] . Dynamic instability of MTs is essential for many of the cellular functions , and the cells actively regulate microtubule growth and shrinkage during many of these crucial cellular processes [6\u201316] . Thus , understanding the mechanism of dynamic instability and its regulation is essential in understanding cell function , and remains a topic of active research . A microtubule is a tube-like structure made of 13 protofilaments ( PFs ) that are formed by polymerizing GTP tubulin ( T ) subunits . These GTP-protofilaments are thought to be straight and form inter-protofilament ( lateral ) bonds with neighbors , stabilizing the tubular structure [17 , 18] . However , the GTP-subunits on the filament hydrolyze into GDP ( D ) subunits and form GDP-rich protofilaments that prefer to be in a curved state [19 , 20] . This induction of curvature leads to a \u201cpower struggle\u201d between inter-protofilament interactions and the bending elasticity of intrinsically curved GDP protofilaments [21\u201323] . It has been been experimentally observed that a GDP-rich microtubule is unstable , forms curved \u201cram\u2019s horn\u201d-like structures , and shrinks rapidly [19\u201320 , 24] . This observation has led to the notion that for microtubules composed of GDP protofilaments",
    "Zoonotic pathogens that cause leprosy ( Mycobacterium leprae ) and tuberculosis ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex , MTBC ) continue to impact modern human populations . Therefore , methods able to survey mycobacterial infection in potential animal hosts are necessary for proper evaluation of human exposure threats . Here we tested for mycobacterial-specific single- and multi-copy loci using qPCR . In a trial study in which armadillos were artificially infected with M . leprae , these techniques were specific and sensitive to pathogen detection , while more traditional ELISAs were only specific . These assays were then employed in a case study to detect M . leprae as well as MTBC in wild marmosets . All marmosets were negative for M . leprae DNA , but 14 were positive for the mycobacterial rpoB gene assay . Targeted capture and sequencing of rpoB and other MTBC genes validated the presence of mycobacterial DNA in these samples and revealed that qPCR is useful for identifying mycobacterial-infected animal hosts . Through the two-way transmission of pathogens between animals and humans , zoonotic diseases have a tremendous impact on modern human populations [1\u20132] . Mycobacterium is one important group of bacteria that has a long history of zoonosis [3] . In particular , the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex ( MTBC ) and Mycobacterium leprae respectively cause tuberculosis and leprosy\u2014diseases that have afflicted humans for centuries and continue to contribute to major public health issues today [4] . Additionally , some mycobacterial pathogens can be transmitted among other animals , so it is important to identify the presence of these pathogens in potential animal reservoirs to assess the potential for disease spread and exposure threats . The progressive respiratory disease tuberculosis is caused by several MTBC species , including M . tuberculosis , M . canettii , M . bovis , M . africanum , and M . microti [5] and can infect ungulates , carnivores , rodents , bats , marsupials , and primates [5\u20138] . Within the primate order , apes , baboons , rhesus macaques , colobus monkeys , mangabeys , langurs , spider monkeys , wooly monkeys , and capuchins can all harbor M . tuberculosis and display tuberculosis symptoms [5 , 8] . Similarly , the chronic disease leprosy , which primarily affects the skin , peripheral nerves , and upper airways , can also infect armadillos , chimpanzees , cynomolgus macaques , sooty mangabeys , rhesus macaques , and African green monkeys [9\u201312] . The abundance of non-human primate mycobacterial reservoirs is likely due to the relatively weak interspecific barrier to zoonotic disease transfer between human and non-human primates [2] . In order to assess human disease spread and exposure threats , it is important to survey the spread of zoonotic mycobacterial infections across primate populations , especially those with close physical proximity to humans [1 , 13] . However , diagnosing such mycobacterial infections in animals is difficult . Many animal tissue collection protocols are invasive and hazardous to investigators",
    "Historically the western sahelian dry regions of Mali are known to be highly endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) caused by Leishmania major , while cases are rarely reported from the Southern savanna forest of the country . Here , we report baseline prevalence of CL infection in 3 ecologically distinct districts of Mali ( dry sahelian , north savanna and southern savanna forest areas ) . We screened 195 to 250 subjects from 50 to 60 randomly selected households in each of the 6 villages ( four from the western sahelian district of Diema in Kayes region , one from the central district of Kolokani and one from the southern savanna district of Kolodieba , region of Sikasso ) . The screening consisted of: 1] A Leishmanin Skin Test ( LST ) for detection of exposure to Leishmania parasites; 2] clinical examination of suspected lesions , followed by validation with PCR and 3] finger prick blood sample to determine antibody levels to sand fly saliva . LST positivity was higher in the western district of Diema ( 49 . 9% ) than in Kolokani ( 24 . 9% ) and was much lower in Kolondieba ( 2 . 6% ) . LST positivity increased with age rising from 13 . 8% to 88% in Diema for age groups 2\u20135 years and 41\u201365 years , respectively . All eight PCR-confirmed L . major CL cases were diagnosed in subjects below 18 years of age and all were residents of the district of Diema . Exposure to sand fly bites , measured by anti-saliva antibody titers , was comparable in individuals living in all three districts . However , antibody titers were significantly higher in LST positive individuals ( P<0 . 0001 ) . In conclusion , CL transmission remains active in the western region of Mali where lesions were mainly prevalent among children under 18 years old . LST positivity correlated to higher levels of antibodies to sand fly salivary proteins , suggesting their potential as a risk marker for CL acquisition in Mali . Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by Leishmania , a protozoan transmitted to humans by the bite of the sand fly [1] . There are different forms and clinical manifestations of the disease that depend primarily on the Leishmania species incriminated . The major clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis are visceral , muco-cutaneous or cutaneous . CL is currently endemic in 87 countries worldwide [2] including 20 countries of the New World ( South and Central America ) and in 67 countries in the Old World ( Europe , Africa , Middle East , central Asia and the Indian subcontinent ) . An estimated 500 , 000\u20131 , 000 , 000 new cases occur annually but only a small fraction of cases ( 19%\u201337% ) are actually reported to health authorities [3] . In the Old World , cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) is the most common form of the disease . Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by",
    "Protein output from synonymous codons is thought to be equivalent if appropriate tRNAs are sufficiently abundant . Here we show that mRNAs encoding iterated lysine codons , AAA or AAG , differentially impact protein synthesis: insertion of iterated AAA codons into an ORF diminishes protein expression more than insertion of synonymous AAG codons . Kinetic studies in E . coli reveal that differential protein production results from pausing on consecutive AAA-lysines followed by ribosome sliding on homopolymeric A sequence . Translation in a cell-free expression system demonstrates that diminished output from AAA-codon-containing reporters results from premature translation termination on out of frame stop codons following ribosome sliding . In eukaryotes , these premature termination events target the mRNAs for Nonsense-Mediated-Decay ( NMD ) . The finding that ribosomes slide on homopolymeric A sequences explains bioinformatic analyses indicating that consecutive AAA codons are under-represented in gene-coding sequences . Ribosome \u2018sliding\u2019 represents an unexpected type of ribosome movement possible during translation . Messenger RNA ( mRNA ) transcripts can contain errors that result in the production of incorrect protein products . Both bacterial and eukaryotic cells have evolved mechanisms to deal with such errors which involve ( 1 ) proteolytic degradation of the aberrant protein product , ( 2 ) mRNA decay and ( 3 ) ribosome rescue ( Shoemaker and Green , 2012 ) . One such mRNA surveillance pathway in eukaryotes targets mRNAs that lack stop codons ( Non-Stop-Decay or NSD ) . In these cases , actively translating ribosomes are thought to read into the 3\u2032 terminal poly ( A ) sequence of the mRNA triggering ribosome pausing as poly ( lysine ) is translated , followed by the recruitment of ubiquitin ligases , mRNA decay and ribosome recycling factors ( review Klauer and van Hoof , 2012 ) . Given the substantial amount of premature ( or alternative ) polyadenylation that has been documented in eukaryotes ( Ozsolak et al . , 2010 ) , it seems that such an mRNA surveillance pathway might have considerable biological significance . Similarly , in bacteria , while no \u2018NSD-like\u2019 response has been characterized , it is known that poly ( A ) sequences are added to mRNAs in the process of being degraded ( review Dreyfus and R\u00e9gnier , 2002 ) , and so ribosomes on these mRNAs may encounter similar challenges . The utilization in bacteria and eukaryotes of 3\u2032 poly ( A ) tails as non-coding elements may reflect a common solution to the challenges for the ribosome in translating such sequences . Most studies investigating how NSD works have been conducted in yeast using reporter constructs . Early studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that mRNAs lacking stop-codons are targeted for decay both in a reaction dependent on the exosome-associated factor Ski7 ( van Hoof et al . , 2002 ) and in a more canonical degradation reaction involving decapping and 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonucleolytic degradation ( Frischmeyer et al . , 2002 ) .

    "Human blood V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells , monocytes and neutrophils share a responsiveness toward inflammatory chemokines and are rapidly recruited to sites of infection . Studying their interaction in vitro and relating these findings to in vivo observations in patients may therefore provide crucial insight into inflammatory events . Our present data demonstrate that V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells provide potent survival signals resulting in neutrophil activation and the release of the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL8 ( IL-8 ) . In turn , V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells readily respond to neutrophils harboring phagocytosed bacteria , as evidenced by expression of CD69 , interferon ( IFN ) -\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -\u03b1 . This response is dependent on the ability of these bacteria to produce the microbial metabolite ( E ) -4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate ( HMB-PP ) , requires cell-cell contact of V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells with accessory monocytes through lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 ( LFA-1 ) , and results in a TNF-\u03b1 dependent proliferation of V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells . The antibiotic fosmidomycin , which targets the HMB-PP biosynthesis pathway , not only has a direct antibacterial effect on most HMB-PP producing bacteria but also possesses rapid anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting \u03b3\u03b4 T cell responses in vitro . Patients with acute peritoneal-dialysis ( PD ) -associated bacterial peritonitis \u2013 characterized by an excessive influx of neutrophils and monocytes into the peritoneal cavity \u2013 show a selective activation of local V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells by HMB-PP producing but not by HMB-PP deficient bacterial pathogens . The \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-driven perpetuation of inflammatory responses during acute peritonitis is associated with elevated peritoneal levels of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and TNF-\u03b1 and detrimental clinical outcomes in infections caused by HMB-PP positive microorganisms . Taken together , our findings indicate a direct link between invading pathogens , neutrophils , monocytes and microbe-responsive \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in early infection and suggest novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches . The cellular immune system consists of an \u2018innate\u2019 arm of phagocytes and antigen-presenting cells , and an \u2018adaptive\u2019 arm of antigen-specific lymphocytes capable of developing immunological memory . Yet , there is increasing evidence of considerable crosstalk between the two [1] . Innate responses directly influence the shape and outcome of adaptive T cell responses , and vice versa specialized T cell subsets feedback to innate cells [2] . Among these interactions , the regulation of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses by Th17 cells has received enormous attention over the past few years [3] , and with the emergence of novel T cell subsets additional networks are being proposed so that each polarized T cell eventually pairs with an innate counter player [4]\u2013[7] . The necessity to integrate complex signals in order to mount the most effective defense is best illustrated by the existence of \u2018unconventional\u2019 T cells bridging the classical divide between innate and adaptive immunity , such as natural killer T cells , mucosal-associated invariant T cells , intestinal intraepithelial CD8\u03b1\u03b1+ T cells and dendritic epidermal \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [8]\u2013[14] . These often tissue-associated lymphocytes",
    "Genome-wide scanning for signals of recent positive selection is essential for a comprehensive and systematic understanding of human adaptation . Here , we present a genomic survey of recent local selective sweeps , especially aimed at those nearly or recently completed . A novel approach was developed for such signals , based on contrasting the extended haplotype homozygosity ( EHH ) profiles between populations . We applied this method to the genome single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) data of both the International HapMap Project and Perlegen Sciences , and detected widespread signals of recent local selection across the genome , consisting of both complete and partial sweeps . A challenging problem of genomic scans of recent positive selection is to clearly distinguish selection from neutral effects , given the high sensitivity of the test statistics to departures from neutral demographic assumptions and the lack of a single , accurate neutral model of human history . We therefore developed a new procedure that is robust across a wide range of demographic and ascertainment models , one that indicates that certain portions of the genome clearly depart from neutrality . Simulations of positive selection showed that our tests have high power towards strong selection sweeps that have undergone fixation . Gene ontology analysis of the candidate regions revealed several new functional groups that might help explain some important interpopulation differences in phenotypic traits . In approximately the past 50 , 000 years , anatomically modern human emerged from Africa and colonized most of the globe . During this relatively short time , humans encountered numerous novel environments with drastically different climates , pathogens , and food sources . In addition , several important cultural developments undoubtedly had far-reaching consequences , such as the introduction of various forms of agriculture , the domestication of animals , and increasing population density , resulting in conditions favorable for epidemics and infectious diseases . It thus seems likely that there has been ample opportunity for human populations to have adapted by natural selection to the extreme changes that have accompanied their recent expansion . Detection of recent , local positive selection has long been a pivotal issue of population genetics and is of increasing interest to human geneticists [1\u20137] . However , demonstrating conclusively that local selection has operated on a gene remains a difficult task because it involves several aspects: demonstrating that patterns of allelic variation at the gene are not consistent with neutrality; that there is a functional difference between alleles; and finally , that the functional difference would result in a phenotypic effect that would be influenced by selection . Such efforts have been mostly focused on individual candidate genes [6] , and very few have had all these aspects demonstrated to some degree at least; examples of genes for which all these aspects have been shown include the lactose tolerance gene LCT [8] , salt-regulation genes at the CYP3A cluster [9] , several disease resistance genes , e . g .",

Human SAMD9 , a tumor suppressor and a restriction factor for poxviruses in cell lines , is antagonized by two classes of poxvirus proteins , represented by vaccinia virus ( VACV ) K1 and C7 . A paralog of SAMD9 , SAMD9L , is also encoded by some mammals , while only one of two paralogs is retained by others . Here , we show that SAMD9L functions similarly to SAMD9 as a restriction factor and that the two paralogs form a critical host barrier that poxviruses must overcome to establish infection . In mice , which naturally lack SAMD9 , overcoming SAMD9L restriction with viral inhibitors is essential for poxvirus replication and pathogenesis . While a VACV deleted of both K1 and C7 ( vK1L-C7L- ) was restricted by mouse cells and highly attenuated in mice , its replication and virulence were completely restored in SAMD9L-/- mice . In humans , both SAMD9 and SAMD9L are poxvirus restriction factors , although the latter requires interferon induction in many cell types . While knockout of SAMD9 with Crispr-Cas9 was sufficient for abolishing the restriction for vK1L-C7L- in many human cells , knockout of both paralogs was required for abolishing the restriction in interferon-treated cells . Both paralogs are antagonized by VACV K1 , C7 and C7 homologs from diverse mammalian poxviruses , but mouse SAMD9L is resistant to the C7 homolog encoded by a group of poxviruses with a narrow host range in ruminants , indicating that host species-specific difference in SAMD9/SAMD9L genes serves as a barrier for cross-species poxvirus transmission . Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases have continued to pose a major threat to public health . In particular , zoonotic viral infections have caused such lethal human diseases as SARS , avian influenza , human monkeypox , and Ebola [1] . For many viruses , including coronaviruses and influenza viruses , host species-specific difference in viral entry receptors presents a major hurdle for cross-species transmission [2] . Poxviruses , however , can enter nearly any animal cell [3] . Why many poxviruses show strict host species specificity and what it would take for them to jump to new hosts are less clear [4] . Poxviruses include many lethal animal and human pathogens [5] , the most infamous of which is the smallpox-causing variola virus . Smallpox was successfully eradicated mainly through a global immunization program with vaccinia virus ( VACV ) , and routine VACV vaccination had since discontinued . The human population is now vulnerable to zoonotic orthopoxvirus infection , as some extant poxviruses related to variola virus are capable of infecting a wide variety of wild and domestic animals . There are also many poxviruses with a more restricted host range [6] . For example , capripoxviruses , consisting of sheeppox virus , goatpox virus , and lumpy skin disease virus , have a very narrow host-range in",
    "ClinicalTrials . gov ( NCT01261130 for the Brazil trial and NCT01385189 for the US trial ) Over 400 million people are infected with hookworm , predominantly in resource-limited tropical regions of the world [1] . Hookworm is a soil-transmitted nematode helminth that is primarily acquired after skin contact with infective larvae found in soil contaminated with human feces . Following penetration of the skin , larvae migrate through tissues before entering the gastrointestinal tract where they develop into adult worms that attach to the intestinal mucosa and feed on host blood [2] . Chronic infection , which often lasts for years , can result in pathology due to intestinal blood loss , with morbidity being proportional to the number of worms present in the host [3] . Heavier infections are more likely to result in iron-deficiency anemia , which impairs physical and intellectual development in children , negatively impacts birth outcomes , and is thought to significantly reduce future economic productivity [4] . New estimates of the global burden of disease caused by hookworm indicate that over 4 million disability-adjusted life years are lost annually and economic costs may exceed $100 billion [5] . Current hookworm control measures consist of regular mass drug administration with a benzimidazole anthelminthic such as albendazole or mebendazole [2] . However , this strategy has several limitations , including rapid re-infection following treatment due to continued exposure to larvae in the environment and the potential development of drug resistance [5] . A vaccine that would prevent acquisition of moderate or heavy intensity infections would therefore be a major advance in reducing morbidity associated with hookworm infection [6 , 7] . Modeling the economic and epidemiologic impact of an effective hookworm vaccine predicts that when used in settings of high transmission , it would be both a highly cost-effective\u2013and even cost-saving\u2013biotechnology [5] . The survival of adult hookworms residing in the human intestine is dependent upon the degradation and utilization of host hemoglobin that the worms ingest during blood meals [8] . Following hemolysis of ingested erythrocytes , adult N . americanus hookworms use a series of hemoglobinases to cleave hemoglobin into smaller molecules that are used by the parasite to satisfy nutritional and biochemical requirements [8\u201313] . As a result of hemoglobin digestion , free heme and related products such as hematin are produced . Because both heme and hematin contain oxidative iron , they are potent generators of toxic reactive oxygen species that can potentially damage parasite macromolecules unless they are bound and detoxified by molecules such as glutathione S-transferase-1 ( GST-1 ) [14\u201316] . GST-1 of N . americanus ( Na-GST-1 ) is therefore a critical component of the blood-feeding pathway of this hookworm . When this antigen is produced as a recombinant protein and used as a vaccine , we hypothesize that it will induce neutralizing antibodies that will interfere with heme detoxification following blood digestion and thereby induce parasite death or reduce worm fecundity , thereby interrupting transmission . Na-GST-1 is",
    "The ability to revise one\u2019s certainty or confidence in a preceding choice is a critical feature of adaptive decision-making but the neural mechanisms underpinning this metacognitive process have yet to be characterized . In the present study , we demonstrate that the same build-to-threshold decision variable signal that triggers an initial choice continues to evolve after commitment , and determines the timing and accuracy of self-initiated error detection reports by selectively representing accumulated evidence that the preceding choice was incorrect . We also show that a peri-choice signal generated in medial frontal cortex provides a source of input to this post-decision accumulation process , indicating that metacognitive judgments are not solely based on the accumulation of feedforward sensory evidence . These findings impart novel insights into the generative mechanisms of metacognition . The ability to detect errors is an essential feature of adaptive behavior , providing the basis for adjusting or countermanding ongoing actions and optimizing future decision-making ( David et al . , 2012; Fernandez-Duque et al . , 2000; Fleming et al . , 2012 ) . Establishing the neurocomputational principles underpinning this key metacognitive function is therefore a major imperative . Categorical choices are thought to be made by integrating evidence over time into a decision variable that triggers action upon reaching a criterion ( Gold and Shadlen , 2007; Kelly and O'Connell , 2014; Shadlen and Kiani , 2013; Smith and Ratcliff , 2004 ) . Most theoretical models of metacognition propose that the same decision variable makes a key contribution to internal representations of choice accuracy ( de Martino et al . , 2013; Heath , 1984; Kiani et al . , 2014; Kiani and Shadlen , 2009; Link , 2003; Moran et al . , 2015; Pleskac and Busemeyer , 2010; Ratcliff and Starns , 2013; Yu et al . , 2015 ) . However , there is considerable uncertainty regarding the precise nature of this contribution . Initial efforts to model metacognitive performance centered on the proposition that our confidence in a choice is based on a read-out of the level the decision variable has reached at the time of choice commitment ( Heath , 1984; Kiani et al . , 2014; Kiani and Shadlen , 2009; Link , 2003 ) . However , the specification that the decision variable reaches a fixed threshold prior to commitment means that these models cannot account for the fact that human participants can retrospectively categorize certain choices as erroneous even in the absence of external feedback ( Rabbitt and Vyas , 1981; Rabbitt , 1966; Yeung et al . , 2004 ) . To take account of this kind of observation , alternative theoretical models have been proposed in which metacognitive judgments can exploit additional evidence that is accumulated after first-order commitment ( Moran et al . , 2015; Pleskac and Busemeyer , 2010; Yu et al . , 2015 ) . However , a definitive neurophysiological demonstration of post-decisional evidence accumulation has yet to be",
    "The oscillating concentration of intracellular calcium is one of the most important examples for collective dynamics in cell biology . Localized releases of calcium through clusters of inositol 1 , 4 , 5-trisphosphate receptor channels constitute elementary signals called calcium puffs . Coupling by diffusing calcium leads to global releases and waves , but the exact mechanism of inter-cluster coupling and triggering of waves is unknown . To elucidate the relation of puffs and waves , we here model a cluster of IP3R channels using a gating scheme with variable non-equilibrium IP3 binding . Hybrid stochastic and deterministic simulations show that puffs are not stereotyped events of constant duration but are sensitive to stimulation strength and residual calcium . For increasing IP3 concentration , the release events become modulated at a timescale of minutes , with repetitive wave-like releases interspersed with several puffs . This modulation is consistent with experimental observations we present , including refractoriness and increase of puff frequency during the inter-wave interval . Our results suggest that waves are established by a random but time-modulated appearance of sustained release events , which have a high potential to trigger and synchronize activity throughout the cell . Transient and repetitive increases in the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ are ubiquitous chemical cues in a cell . They are crucial for neuronal adaptation , cell growth and myocyte function , to name a few examples . The formation of complex intracellular release patterns plays an important role in cell communication , since Ca2+ achieves its functional specificity by differential signaling in space , time , and amplitude [1] . It is therefore a purpose of numerous research studies to understand the systemic generation of cytosolic Ca2+ signals [2] . In many non-excitable cells , increasing the concentration of inositol 1 , 4 , 5-trisphosphate ( IP3 ) triggers Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) by activating intracellular IP3 receptor ( IP3R ) channels in the ER membrane . Opening of IP3R channels is induced by the binding of IP3 and Ca2+ [3] and therefore Ca2+ released from open channels and diffusing through the cell can recruit further IP3R channels to open . If the IP3 stimulation is modest , Ca2+ is released from spatially confined clusters of intracellular Ca2+ channels [4] . Molecular interactions within a cluster lead to coherent opening of its channels and result in local elementary events called puffs [5]\u2013[7] . The small number of IP3R channels involved in a puff ( 10 ) and the random appearance of puffs suggest their spontaneous generation by microscopic fluctuations , which has been related to classical excitability in activator-inhibitor systems [8] , [9] . For larger stimulation , however , Ca2+ forms more regular spatio-temporal waves or whole-cell oscillations involving release by multiple clusters and many channels [10]\u2013[12] . The transition from small localized release to Ca2+ waves across cells has been addressed by a large number of experimental and theoretical studies , see e . g",
    "We present a new computational model of speech motor control: the Feedback-Aware Control of Tasks in Speech or FACTS model . FACTS employs a hierarchical state feedback control architecture to control simulated vocal tract and produce intelligible speech . The model includes higher-level control of speech tasks and lower-level control of speech articulators . The task controller is modeled as a dynamical system governing the creation of desired constrictions in the vocal tract , after Task Dynamics . Both the task and articulatory controllers rely on an internal estimate of the current state of the vocal tract to generate motor commands . This estimate is derived , based on efference copy of applied controls , from a forward model that predicts both the next vocal tract state as well as expected auditory and somatosensory feedback . A comparison between predicted feedback and actual feedback is then used to update the internal state prediction . FACTS is able to qualitatively replicate many characteristics of the human speech system: the model is robust to noise in both the sensory and motor pathways , is relatively unaffected by a loss of auditory feedback but is more significantly impacted by the loss of somatosensory feedback , and responds appropriately to externally-imposed alterations of auditory and somatosensory feedback . The model also replicates previously hypothesized trade-offs between reliance on auditory and somatosensory feedback and shows for the first time how this relationship may be mediated by acuity in each sensory domain . These results have important implications for our understanding of the speech motor control system in humans . A schematic control diagram of the FACTS model is shown in Fig 1 . Modules that build on Task Dynamics are shown in blue , and the articulatory state estimation process ( or observer ) is shown in red . Following Task Dynamics , speech tasks in the FACTS model are hypothesized to be desired constrictions in the vocal tract ( e . g . , close the lips for a [b] ) . Each of these speech tasks , or gestures , can be specified in terms of it\u2019s constriction location ( where in the vocal tract the constriction is formed ) and it\u2019s constriction degree ( how narrow the constriction is ) . We model each gesture as a separate critically-damped second-order system [32] . Interestingly , similar dynamical behavior has been seen at a neural population level during the planning and execution of reaching movements in non-human primates [38 , 39] and recently in human speech movements [40] , suggesting that a dynamical systems model of task-level control may be an appropriate first approximation to the neural activity that controls movement production . However , the architecture of the model would also allow for tasks in other control spaces , such as auditory targets ( c . f . [13 , 19] ) , though an appropriate task feedback control law for such targets would need to be developed ( consistent with engineering",
    "Kingella kingae is an encapsulated gram-negative organism that is a common cause of osteoarticular infections in young children . In earlier work , we identified a glycosyltransferase gene called csaA that is necessary for synthesis of the [3 ) -\u03b2-GalpNAc- ( 1\u21925 ) -\u03b2-Kdop- ( 2\u2192] polysaccharide capsule ( type a ) in K . kingae strain 269\u2013492 . In the current study , we analyzed a large collection of invasive and carrier isolates from Israel and found that csaA was present in only 47% of the isolates . Further examination of this collection using primers based on the sequence that flanks csaA revealed three additional gene clusters ( designated the csb , csc , and csd loci ) , all encoding predicted glycosyltransferases . The csb locus contains the csbA , csbB , and csbC genes and is associated with a capsule that is a polymer of [6 ) -\u03b1-GlcpNAc- ( 1\u21925 ) -\u03b2- ( 8-OAc ) Kdop- ( 2\u2192] ( type b ) . The csc locus contains the cscA , cscB , and cscC genes and is associated with a capsule that is a polymer of [3 ) -\u03b2-Ribf- ( 1\u21922 ) -\u03b2-Ribf- ( 1\u21922 ) -\u03b2-Ribf- ( 1\u21924 ) -\u03b2-Kdop- ( 2\u2192] ( type c ) . The csd locus contains the csdA , csdB , and csdC genes and is associated with a capsule that is a polymer of [P- ( O\u21923 ) [\u03b2-Galp- ( 1\u21924 ) ]-\u03b2-GlcpNAc- ( 1\u21923 ) -\u03b1-GlcpNAc-1-] ( type d ) . Introduction of the csa , csb , csc , and csd loci into strain KK01\u0394csa , a strain 269\u2013492 derivative that lacks the native csaA gene , was sufficient to produce the type a capsule , type b capsule , type c capsule , and type d capsule , respectively , indicating that these loci are solely responsible for determining capsule type in K . kingae . Further analysis demonstrated that 96% of the invasive isolates express either the type a or type b capsule and that a disproportionate percentage of carrier isolates express the type c or type d capsule . These results establish that there are at least four structurally distinct K . kingae capsule types and suggest that capsule type plays an important role in promoting K . kingae invasive disease . Kingella kingae is being recognized increasingly as an important cause of bone and joint infections in young children , reflecting more sensitive cultivation techniques and increased availability of molecular-based diagnostic tools [1 , 2] . Among the key surface factors expressed by K . kingae is a polysaccharide capsule [3 , 4] . Capsules are recognized as important virulence factors in many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and have a variety of functions , including inhibiting complement deposition , reducing phagocytosis , and preventing desiccation [5\u20137] . Polysaccharide capsules conjugated to an immunogenic carrier protein also serve as effective vaccine antigens and have dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus",
    "Candida auris is an emerging , multi-drug resistant , health care-associated fungal pathogen . Its predominant prevalence in hospitals and nursing homes indicates its ability to adhere to and colonize the skin , or persist in an environment outside the host\u2014a trait unique from other Candida species . Besides being associated globally with life-threatening disseminated infections , C . auris also poses significant clinical challenges due to its ability to adhere to polymeric surfaces and form highly drug-resistant biofilms . Here , we performed bioinformatic studies to identify the presence of adhesin proteins in C . auris , with sequence as well as 3-D structural homologies to the major adhesin/invasin of C . albicans , Als3 . Anti-Als3p antibodies generated by vaccinating mice with NDV-3A ( a vaccine based on the N-terminus of Als3 protein formulated with alum ) recognized C . auris in vitro , blocked its ability to form biofilms and enhanced macrophage-mediated killing of the fungus . Furthermore , NDV-3A vaccination induced significant levels of C . auris cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses , and protected immunosuppressed mice from lethal C . auris disseminated infection , compared to the control alum-vaccinated mice . The mechanism of protection is attributed to anti-Als3p antibodies and CD4+ T helper cells activating tissue macrophages . Finally , NDV-3A potentiated the protective efficacy of the antifungal drug micafungin , against C . auris candidemia . Identification of Als3-like adhesins in C . auris makes it a target for immunotherapeutic strategies using NDV-3A , a vaccine with known efficacy against other Candida species and safety as well as efficacy in clinical trials . Considering that C . auris can be resistant to almost all classes of antifungal drugs , such an approach has profound clinical relevance . The fungus Candida auris was first detected in 2009 from an ear canal infection in Japan [1] . However , the earliest known strain of C . auris dates back to 1996 isolated in a retrospective analysis of previously misdiagnosed samples from Korea [2] . Since then , C . auris has been reported in more than 20 countries , with a significant number of cases detected in the Unites States [3] . Patients can remain colonized with C . auris for long periods and the yeast can persist on surfaces in healthcare environments , which results in spread of the organism between patients in healthcare facilities [4 , 5] . Clinical isolates of C . auris have been recovered from a variety of specimen types , including normally sterile body fluids , wounds , mucocutaneous surfaces , and skin [4] . However , bloodstream infection remains the most commonly observed clinical manifestation of C . auris , with alarming in-hospital global crude mortality rates of 30 to 60% [6 , 7] . Further and of high importance , some isolates of C . auris exhibit multidrug resistance with elevated MICs to all three major antifungal classes , including azoles , echinocandins , and polyenes",
    "Cutaneous Leishmaniasis ( CL ) is a neglected tropical vector-borne disease . Sand fly vectors ( SF ) and Leishmania spp parasites are sensitive to changes in weather conditions , rendering disease transmission susceptible to changes in local and global scale climatic patterns . Nevertheless , it is unclear how SF abundance is impacted by El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) and how these changes might relate to changes in CL transmission . We studied association patterns between monthly time series , from January 2000 to December 2010 , of: CL cases , rainfall and temperature from Panam\u00e1 , and an ENSO index . We employed autoregressive models and cross wavelet coherence , to quantify the seasonal and interannual impact of local climate and ENSO on CL dynamics . We employed Poisson Rate Generalized Linear Mixed Models to study SF abundance patterns across ENSO phases , seasons and eco-epidemiological settings , employing records from 640 night-trap sampling collections spanning 2000\u20132011 . We found that ENSO , rainfall and temperature were associated with CL cycles at interannual scales , while seasonal patterns were mainly associated with rainfall and temperature . Sand fly ( SF ) vector abundance , on average , decreased during the hot and cold ENSO phases , when compared with the normal ENSO phase , yet variability in vector abundance was largest during the cold ENSO phase . Our results showed a three month lagged association between SF vector abundance and CL cases . Association patterns of CL with ENSO and local climatic factors in Panam\u00e1 indicate that interannual CL cycles might be driven by ENSO , while the CL seasonality was mainly associated with temperature and rainfall variability . CL cases and SF abundance were associated in a fashion suggesting that sudden extraordinary changes in vector abundance might increase the potential for CL epidemic outbreaks , given that CL epidemics occur during the cold ENSO phase , a time when SF abundance shows its highest fluctuations . Cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) is a major neglected tropical disease [1] with a complex ecology [2] , whose transmission , in the New World , requires the co-existence of vectors , reservoirs and humans [3] , [4] . In Panam\u00e1 , detailed studies on the eco-epidemiology of the disease [2] , [5] described parasitological aspects of reservoirs [6] and vectors [7] and the environmental context of parasite-reservoir-vector interactions [8] . These studies set several landmarks for understanding New World CL epidemiology , including the demonstration of two toed sloths , Choloepus hoffmanni [9] , [10] and other mammals [11] , [12] as reservoirs of Leishmania spp parasites . Insights on sand fly vector ecology included: catholic bloodfeeding patterns in dominant vector species [13] , [14] , very limited dispersal of flying adults [15] , high sensitivity of larval biology to environmental factors [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , differential adult resting behavior with species segregating along tree height [21] , large diversity of co-occurring"
